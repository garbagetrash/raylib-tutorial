Raylib Tutorial
===============

This isn't an actual tutorial, just me going through and copying the
[examples](https://www.raylib.com/examples.html) provided to learn what raylib
provides as I go.

The [cheatsheet](https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html) is also a
fantastic reference.

Dependencies
------------

- CMake 3.10+
- raylib installation
